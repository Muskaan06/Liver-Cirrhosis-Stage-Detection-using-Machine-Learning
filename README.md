# Liver-Cirrhosis-Stage-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
This project builds a machine learning model to predict the **histologic stage of liver cirrhosis** using patient-level clinical variables.   It uses real clinical data from a **Mayo Clinic study** on primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) conducted between 1974–1984.
